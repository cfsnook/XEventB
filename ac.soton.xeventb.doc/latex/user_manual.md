# CamilleX Overview

The CamilleX provides new CamilleX constructs (XMachines and XContexts)
which are text files which are automatically translated into the
corresponding Rodin Event-B constructs (i.e., Machine and Context)
accordingly. Facility for translating from Rodin Event-B components to
CamilleX components can be invoked manually. The overall process can be
seen in FigureÂ [1](#fig:overview).

## XEvent-B Editors

### XEvent-B Content Assist

In the XContext and XMachine editors press `Ctrl+Space` on code to
complete. This opens a list of available code completions. Some tips for
using code assist are listed in the following paragraph:

  - You can use the mouse or the keyboard (Up Arrow, Down Arrow, Page
    Up, Page Down, Home, End, Enter) to navigate and select lines in the
    list.

  - Clicking or pressing Enter on a selected line in the list inserts
    the selection into the editor.

### XEvent-B Formatter

In the XContent and XMachine editors press `Ctrl+Shift+F` on code to
format it. If no selection is set then the entire source is formatted
otherwise only the selection will be.

Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code,
documentation and other files maintained in the Rodin SourceForge CVS
repository (âRepositoryâ) in CVS modules (âModulesâ) and made available
as downloadable archives (âDownloadsâ).

  - Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate

    may include plug-ins (âPlug-insâ), plug-in fragments (âFragmentsâ),
    and features (âFeaturesâ).

  - Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR
    (JavaARchive) in a directory named âpluginsâ.

  - A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and
    associated material. Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory
    in a directory named âfeaturesâ. Within a Feature, files named
    âfeature.xmlâ may contain a list of the names and version numbers
    of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.

  - Features may also include other Features (âIncluded Featuresâ).
    Within a Feature, files named âfeature.xmlâ may contain a list of
    the names and version numbers of Included Features.

The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be
contained in files named âabout.htmlâ (âAboutsâ). The terms and
conditions governing Features and Included Features should be contained
in files named âlicense.htmlâ (âFeature Licensesâ). Abouts and Feature
Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or Module

  - The top-level (root) directory

  - Plug-in and Fragment directories

  - Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs

  - Sub-directories of the directory named "src" of certain Plug-ins

  - Feature directories

Note: if a Feature made available by the Rodin Project is installed
using the Eclipse Update Manager, you must agree to a license (âFeature
Update Licenseâ) during the installation process. If the Feature
contains Included Features, the Feature Update License should either
provide you with the terms and conditions governing the Included
Features or inform you where you can locate them. Feature Update
Licenses may be found in the âlicenseâ property of files named
âfeature.propertiesâ found within a Feature. Such Abouts, Feature
Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and conditions
(or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of the
associated Content in that directory.

THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER TO
THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
SOME OF THESE OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED
